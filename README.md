# commander
A simple and intuitive console library to control console applications via commander objects like `CommonCommander` and `ObjectCommander`.

This repository contains the `Rumrunner0.Commander` class library and `Rumrunner0.Commander.Demo` demo project. All the content in the repository is an original work created to simplify the control of console applications in the .NET ecosystem.

## Description
The `Rumrunner0.Commander` is incredibly simple but highly configurable console command control program. Designed as a command-based utility to provide an intuitive interface to control console applications, `Rumrunner0.Commander` allows developers to define specific actions, aliases, confirmation prompts, and more. The library is quite simple so it can be improved in many ways.

The `Rumrunner0.Commander.Demo.Runnable` is a console application demonstrating the usage of the `Rumrunner0.Commander` library.

## Usage

### Rumrunner0.Commander Library
```csharp
using Rumrunner0.Commander.Commanders;
using Rumrunner0.Commander.Commands;
using Rumrunner0.Commander.Demo.Runnable;

// There are 2 different commanders for now: CommonCommander and ObjectCommander.
// Here is usage example of one of the commanders â€“ ObjectCommander.
using var commander = new ObjectCommander<DummyServer>(new DummyServer())
{
    Settings = new ()
    {
        // Default values can be overridden...
        InputPrompt = "Please, enter the command",

        // ...or left as they are (can be omitted).
        ConfirmationPrompt = default!,
        UnknownInputHint = default!,

        // Extra tweaks also have default values
        // but available for override even for specific command.
        UseAliases = true,
        MatchCase = true,
        AskForConfirmation = false
    },
    CustomCommands =
    [
        new ()
        {
            Action = commandable => commandable.Initialize(),
            Settings = new ()
            {
                Name = "initialize",
                Aliases = [ "init" ],

                // Commander will NOT use the aliases of this specific command.
                UseAliases = false
            }
        },
        new ()
        {
            Action = commandable => commandable.Start(),
            Settings = new ()
            {
                Name = "start",
                Aliases = [ "begin", "run" ],

                // Commander WILL treat "Start", "rUn" etc. as valid command names.
                MatchCase = false
            }
        },
        new ()
        {
            Action = commandable => commandable.Stop(),
            Settings = new ()
            {
                Name = "stop",
                Aliases = [ "terminate" ],

                // Commander WILL ask for confirmation.
                // This overrides behaviour specified on Commander level.
                AskForConfirmation = true,
                ConfirmationPrompt = "This command will STOP the server. Are you sure?"
            }
        }
    ],

    // System commands such as "help" or "quit" can be overridden.
    // All parameters are available for override EXCEPT Action and Name.
    SystemCommandsOverrides = new ()
    {
        [Command.System.Name.Quit] = new ()
        {
            Aliases = [ "release", "exit", "qq" ],
            ConfirmationPrompt = "You are about to QUIT the commander. Are you sure?"
        }
    }

// Commander has to be run after the configuration.
}.Run();
```
